### I wanted to see what features influence antler size of mature (4.5- and 5.5-year-old) male white-tailed deer.
* Data: This is a unique dataset from a captive colony of white-tailed deer with known age, antler mass (kg), and maternal / paternal parentage.
* Each male was fed ab libitum one of two kinds of pelleted feed that differed in digestible energy, but had similar protein percentage (16%) from the time they were weaned. The standard energy diet 'S' had 2.65 kcal/g of dietary energy and the low energy diet 'L' had 1.77 kcal/g of dietary energy.

## Methods: 
* Model seletion: These datasets are very small (<100 rows), thus, I used cross-validation to select between three models: random forest, gradient boosting, and xgboosting regressor models
* Feature importance: fit selected models to the 4.5- and 5.5-year-olds dataset to assess important features

## Findings 

### A. 4.5-year-olds
* Antler size of 4.5-year-old males is most influenced by the body mass of the male, which is not surprising, but useful to know for certain. 
* 'Birth wt' is more predictive of antler size in 4.5-year-olds than in 5.5-year-olds. Why? It could be that 4.5-year-olds are still making up for their small body size (and thus antler size) via compensatory growth. Then, by the time they reach 5.5 years, they've made up for their small size, or in other words, there is even less variability in body size (and antler size) among 5.5 year olds.
* The mother ('DID') and father ('DID') were predictive of antler size.
* What's most surprising here is that, when it comes to determing antler size of mature males, it didn't really matter whether males had been eating a low or high energy diet ('Energy') throughout their life.

###  B. 5.5-year-olds
* Body mass is also the most influential feature of antler size in 5.5-year-old males.
* The mother ('DID') and father ('DID') were predictive of antler size.
* Like in 4.5-year-olds, available dietary energy (high versus low; 'Energy') was not very influential.
